  *  cmake
  *  make
  *  cpio
  *  python
  *  unzip
  *  rsync
  *  svn
  *  texinfo-4.13a-8 or similar, because texinfo-5.0-1 is incompatible with
     current buildroot. Error message, which you can fix with downgrade:
     >>  conftest.c:14625: must be after `@defmac' to use `@defmacx'
     >>  make[3]: *** [autoconf.info] Error 1

known problems:
  *  texinfo -- conftest.c:14625 (above)
  *  glibc -- gets is security hole (workaround in night.sh)
