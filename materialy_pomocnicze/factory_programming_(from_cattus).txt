Before start

For factory programming you will need

    sam-ba with configured $PATH
    tftp server with directory /srv/tftp
    ip address 192.168.2.200
    and builded packages 

RomBoot?

Check if there is no important data on module, turn it off.

Short-circuit sam-ba jumper (2 holes on left side module's board).

Turn power on, wait few seconds, turn off and turn on. On connected RS-232 terminal you will see:

RomBoot 
>

Turn power off, remove sam-ba jumper, connect usb-device cable to computer.

Connect module to lan network with your computer and tftp server on 192.168.2.200.
Program bootloader

Turn it on. There will be new device /dev/ttyACM0. You need read-write it. Next run:

./icdtcp3-flash.sh -s /dev/ttyACM0 ../../work/_BUILD/icdtcp3-0.0-25-<version>.tar.bz2

or

./icdtcp3-flash.sh -s /dev/ttyACM0 ../buildroot/output/images/icdtcp3-v0.1-6-g3bab6de.tar.bz2

Assuming that you are in /home/insofter/project/scripts, and <version> is correct this should program bootloader.

DON'T TURN THE POWER OFF!
Downloading linux

Downloading will start automatically.

Be happy with new linux.

Paths are platform and programmers-vision depended :P
